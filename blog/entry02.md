Over the course of these past few months we had to finalize our tool that we wanted to pick. Safe, Ulysses and I chose to finalize our tool picking with [unity](https://unity.com/). Even though we had much trouble trying to install unity editior, it worked non the less and we feel confident in making something with it. During these past few weeks on the mondays, Me Ulysses and Safe huddled up next to each other and worked on our project. We dont have one big project area where we can all three work on at the same time so we all watch one video together and try out the things on our own laptops or computers. Our main focus in the past has been camera angles for deciding how we want our person to look whether it be first person or third person. Our new main focus that we have been working on is animation. We started tinkering by watching videos on how to make our character move. It's not the traditional way of movement which is walking but it is something a little different that still gets the job done: Hovering. We can always make changes in the future with how the character moves but for right now we are trying to learn the basics of movement which is hovering. When I say hovering I dont just mean stanind over one spot just above the ground. I mean being able to glide the character forwards, backwards, left and right.
