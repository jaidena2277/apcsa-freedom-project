During the few weeks we had to tinker with our tools and decide which tool we are going with I had two options. The first option was tinkering with arduinos and the second was tinkering with unity. I decided to watch a few 1 hour or more videos on how arduinos work. Here is the link to the masterclass workshop [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLrHTHUjPuw&t=10s&ab_channel=ProgrammingElectronicsAcademy) Here is the link to the second [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqiIzK97K0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) which is a 10 hour course for everybody. I did not watch the full 10 hours, only 2 hours of it. After doing some research in learning how to use the arduino I decided to try unity. This was a bit difficult for me because unity editor did not want to install on my pc no matter how much I tried. Every time I pressed install, the progress bar would turn orange immediatly and only would turn blue if my pc was lagging and tricking me. After continously trying for about a week it decided to magically start installing. With this I was now able to tinker like a pro on my unity editor. My friends call me tinkering tom. When I opened up my starting project template It already had a camera in it. This gave me the idea to want to figure out whether my partners and I should make our game third person or first person. So I started tinkering with the angle of the camera but I realized i also needed an object to have the right pespective. I went online and searched up free unity assets and to my surprise
