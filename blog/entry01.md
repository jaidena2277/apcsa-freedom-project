During the few weeks, we had to tinker with our tools and decide which tool we were going with. I had two options. The first option was tinkering with Arduino, and the second was tinkering with Unity. I decided to watch a few 1 hour or more videos on how Arduino work. Here is the link to the masterclass workshop [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLrHTHUjPuw&t=10s&ab_channel=ProgrammingElectronicsAcademy) Here is the link to the second [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqiIzK97K0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) which is a 10-hour course for everybody. I did not watch the full 10 hours; I only watched 2 hours of it. After doing some research in learning how to use the Arduino I decided to try [unity](https://unity.com/). This was a bit difficult for me because the Unity editor did not want to install it on my PC, no matter how much I tried. Every time I pressed install, the progress bar would turn orange immediately and would only turn blue if my PC was lagging and tricking me. After continuously trying for about a week, it decided to magically start installing. With this, I was now able to tinker like a pro on my Unity editor. My friends call me Tinkering Tom. When I opened up my starting project template, It already had a camera in it. This gave me the idea to want to figure out whether my partners and I should make our game third person or first person. So, I started tinkering with the angle of the camera, but I realized I also needed an object to have the right perspective. I went online and searched up [free unity assets store](https://assetstore.unity.com/top-assets/top-free), and to my surprise I found nice character designs I could use. I was able to animate one of them and just move the other one, but the main goal of the tinkering was to see how well 3rd person and first person looked on unity. Here is what the character looked like in the eyes of the camera: ![image](https://github.com/jaidena2277/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/91745222/cfd2c380-5f0c-4841-9b8e-d53fd34e9b0c) Now that we tinkered and found the tool we want to use, We are going to make a free roam, open world game that you could explore.
Currently, in the EDP, we are in the stages of one and two. We have tinkered but have not finished and will keep going back and forth with tinkering(defining) and adding more to our game(research). In terms of skills, I would say I have been using collaboration (asking safe nasher for help to import and download my assets), how to learn(trying to figure out how to animate and move each limb without help and trying to remember what each axis does, and how to read(Had read the documentation on unity website before getting unity hub and editor.
