During the few weeks we had to tinker with our tools and decide which tool we are going with I had two options. The first option was tinkering with arduinos and the second was tinkering with unity. I decided to watch a few 1 hour or more videos on how arduinos work. Here is the link to the masterclass workshop [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLrHTHUjPuw&t=10s&ab_channel=ProgrammingElectronicsAcademy) Here is the link to the second [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqiIzK97K0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) which is a 10 hour course for everybody. I did not watch the full 10 hours, only 2 hours of it.
