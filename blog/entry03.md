Over the 2 months that we had to work on our freedom project we have improved quite a bit. Last time, we started learning animation to get the people in our game to move around and start floating. Going back to a previous blog where I mentioned working on the camera setting for third person and first person. I was able to do third person but more in depth and add animation so that the camera follows the character as the person is moving. In my previous attempt, I had a third person view but it wasnt working like how I wanted it to. It would be in a fixed position and wouldnt move around in a dynamic way. The improvements I have made has revolutionized our project as it adds a simple but key detail to take our game to the next level as we will be implementing this feature into all of the characters we make later on in the future. The fluid movement is able to move with the cursor so you can control the view of the character. Before this improvement, the character would be floating around and the camera is locked on to the movement of the character. Other major aspects of this game have been improved on such as the animation. The animation before was a bit dull. There was just a character floating and thats what I was able to do. After doing some research by watching [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXz5b_9z0Bc) and tutorials, I was able to make the character feel like any other character from a big game company such as fortnite or other popular games. Im not saying that the animation is just as detailed and developed as other games but it is definitely realistic. During this entire process I had trouble with an import because it turned my entire screen pink and I didnt know how to fix it. I tried googling it but it gave me 2/3 of the answer to my problem. I went to the right place but there was too many buttons I had to check and I didnt want to mess up my game because what I googled didnt tell me what to check. I went on youtube to find more tutorials later on and read in the comments that someone the extra step that I needed. Another problem I had was that the imports were out of date and werent compatible with my current version. I was thinking about giving up and trying something different but then I decided to keep reading and found a compatible version.

Here is a picture of the character jumping to show how the animation looks. I moves the character next to a wall so you can see the difference in height from the ground to the wall.

In this picture I am showing the walking animation and how you can see the legs are moving. There is a sprint which the character can do that I had to import through the [assets store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-thirdperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196526?aid=1101l96nj&pubref=starterassets&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=partnerize-linkmaker) but its hard to show the character sprinting because when I try to pause the project the character stops moving before I can press the pause button so walking is the best I can show you.

Currently, in the EDP(engineering design process), we are in the stages of one and two. We have tinkered but have not finished and will keep going back and forth with tinkering(defining) and adding more to our game(research). In terms of skills, I would say I have been using using google(searched up my problem with the pink screen) and embracing failure(a version of import wasnt compatible).
