Over the 2 months that we had to work on our freedom project we have improved quite a bit. Last time, we started learning animation to get the people in our game to move around and start floating. Going back to a previous blog where I mentioned working on the camera setting for third person and first person. I was able to do third person but more in depth and add animation so that the camera follows the character as the person is moving. In my previous attempt, I had a third person view but it wasnt working like how I wanted it to. It would be in a fixed position and wouldnt move around in a dynamic way. The improvements I have made has revolutionized our project as it adds a simple but key detail to take our game to the next level as we will be implementing this feature into all of the characters we make later on in the future. The fluid movement is able to move with the cursor so you can control the view of the character. Before this improvement, the character would be floating around and the camera is locked on to the movement of the character. Other major aspects of this game have been improved on such as the animation. The animation before was a bit dull. There was just a character floating and thats what I was able to do. After doing some research by watching videos and tutorials, I was able to make the character feel like any other character from a big game company such as fortnite or other popular games. Im not saying that the animation is just as detailed and developed as other games but it is definitely realistic.
