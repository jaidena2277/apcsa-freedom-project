### Map development and change in pov
During the past month, my team and I have been working on further developing the map. As you may have saw from my project partner Ulysses Sorianos blog entry 3, the map was just at a small stage. Nothing too fancy and we were just understanding how to move the blocks around. After helping out with the map for some time, I have learned how to maneuver the pieces to my will very fast and efficiently. At the start it was very slow because I didnt fully understand how each tool worked. There was six tools in total and I was able to fully utilize four out of the six since there was no need to use the last two. The tools were very handy because the whole time I was making the project it was crooked. Having to rotate and scale up or down the pieces was a pain for sure. As time went on I managed to be able to quickly correct the crookedness as the map elongated. The map on my end was giving me some hard times as I didnt use blender so I didnt know how to make buildings from scratch. I used the free resources as best as I could in the  [ assets store](https://assetstore.unity.com/popular-assets/cities?clickref=1101lyifNRmj&utm_source=partnerize&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate#free-cities-fZwT). It was quite tough looking for nice quality free assets but I managed to find a handfull of lowpoly assets. I used around six to eight free assets to build the map. Here is what it looks like: ![image](https://github.com/jaidena2277/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/91745222/6dfada75-bde0-4e3a-a16d-386b10e2df83)
