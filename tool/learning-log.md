During this week I started looking into the two different tools. First was Adruinos and second was unity. 
the first half of the week was thinking about what to make and watching videos on adruinos. Such as this [90 minute video](https://youtu.be/BLrHTHUjPuw?si=UR6eyHlZbrSVN9N3).After watching this video and thinking of a project to make I decided to switch to unity. I couldnt really tinker much besides watching [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) aswell and this one was a 10 hour long video but I only watched the first hr and a half of it so far. I was and still am not able to download the editor for unity on my home pc so I have just been watching videos and checking everything out on the website and hub.
